Chrome extension to keep track of information during a game of dominion on
dominion.isotropic.org.

The extension keeps track of:
- # of cards each player has
- # of points each player has

It can optionally show this beside the chat box (instead of the exit / faq
buttons) and always answers !status commands to print the scores to all
players.

Optionally, the extension can print something in the lobby so people know you
are using it. It can also be set to allow opponents to disable the extension if
they don't like point counting.

Known issues:
- Masquerade with more than 2 players leads to unknown information.

If you'd like to contribute back you can work from source here.
If you'd just like to use the extension, you can install it automatically:
